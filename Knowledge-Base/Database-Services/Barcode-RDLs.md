Subject: RE: Can you upload our standard .rdl files for CRMC? 

Dan - That rdl, along with the other wristband/label rdl’s have been uploaded.

Patrick/Brian – you’ve mentioned in the past that you’ve had difficulties getting the barcode dll uploaded in the correct spot in order to successfully upload the wristband/label rdl’s to the report server.  I made some updates to the barcode install doc (link below), so hopefully you will have success the next go-around.  If you do run into any issues, don’t hesitate to reach out to me, and we can look into it together.  Any questions, please let me know.
