Highlighted below is the registry key that controls whether you can manually enter in the URN/MRN during the Registration Wizard.
By default, Value1 is set to TRUE, meaning you cannot manually enter in the URN.
To open up the URN/MRN so you can manually enter it in during Registration, simply update Value1 to FALSE, as seen below.
So weâ€™ll want to open that up during the backload, but then close it off once the backload has been completed (I would assume).
