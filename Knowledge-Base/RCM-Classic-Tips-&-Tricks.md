# 1. TAB is your friend
the TAB key is the best way to **quickly navigate fields or confirm a selection and move on to the next step**.. when in doubt, hit TAB!

# 2. Use %% when you want a quick list of results
this is very helpful for testing scenarios to quickly get a list of records or when you're simply not sure what data a **text field** returns.

# 3. Don't forget about Help!
