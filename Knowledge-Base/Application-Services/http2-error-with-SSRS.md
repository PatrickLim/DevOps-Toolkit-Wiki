Strange error with SSRS installed on Windows 2022, in particular ap03w1-gch for Guadalupe.

Fresh navigation to the reportserver url resulted in "ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR" until navigating in that same browser session to the reports url. Then navigating back to the reportserver url was fine. But it always happens on a new browser session!
