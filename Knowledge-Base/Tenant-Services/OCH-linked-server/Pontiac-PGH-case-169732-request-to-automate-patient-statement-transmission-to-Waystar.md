This request was made by Terri Kalinski because her last day at Pontiac PGH was on December 15, 2022.

Initially, the Support and Implementation teams "hot potatoed" this case because they assumed that the request was to develop a custom process to generate Patient Statements.

But after Patrick Lim talked to Terri Kalinski, she clarified that the Patient Statements were already getting generated, she just needed to FTP the files to Waystar on a Windows Scheduled Task.

The Waystar FTP creds are:
53501
F(vtm;Z5+$U3

The Windows Scheduled Task is running on INSIGHTCLIENT (146.82.52.45) called "PatientStatementToWaystar":
