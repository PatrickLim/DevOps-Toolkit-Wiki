Not sure if you'll have access to these as they might be locked out in the KB for admins only, let me know, most of this was intially pulled from old documentation that lives in sharepoint now.

http://stlvmonlinehelp/KB/article.php?id=21 -- General overview of some 837 information

http://stlvmonlinehelp/KB/article.php?id=74 & http://stlvmonlinehelp/KB/article.php?id=140 -- These are specific code-based options we can use in the edi_837_msg_rules table to manipulate or create data differently on the claim file.

all of the information on the 837 is informed by a set of ANSI standards. there's some 2000 page pdf's on sharepoint that detail the specifics of all the details we can include on a claim file and how they should be formatted according to the national standards.
