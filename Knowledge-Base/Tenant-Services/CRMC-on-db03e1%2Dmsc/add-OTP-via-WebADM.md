Step one search the user in question. 

If the user is not activated, click Yes Activate Now.

Accept the defaults and just click Proceed:

![==image_0==.png](/.attachments/==image_0==-5c55fcc2-4c74-48ab-a27b-65bc6f005743.png) 

Once on the user click here
![==image_0==.png](/.attachments/==image_0==-5709c064-df0f-4480-a72b-4da043f8f55f.png) 
Then choose Register/unregister OTP tokens
![==image_1==.png](/.attachments/==image_1==-e7a416d3-b702-4376-83b4-35d9ec4362b2.png) 
This section shows their token and if they are enabled
![==image_2==.png](/.attachments/==image_2==-d859d5eb-c375-418b-b930-47e1167c9831.png) 
For this test user they have a primary I do not want to remove so I am clicking on the secondary token from the drop down.
Next choose I use another token (manual registration)
Then change the Key format to Base 32.  This is critical for function. Everything should match  the image below before continuing. 

![==image_3==.png](/.attachments/==image_3==-67ca57d2-d555-4b86-9838-986fbeb145b4.png) 
The next step is to change the Key Mode: to Key generated by server.  This must be done in order.  If you did not change the Key Format to Base32 first, you have to cancel at this point and try again. 
After where the Green arrow is will fill in with a Secret Key: You **MUST COPY THIS BEFORE YOU REGISTER**.  You cannot find it after. 
![==image_4==.png](/.attachments/==image_4==-94cceadf-afa8-4c22-9ffb-68b42bb44fc7.png) 
Now for this test user I did register it, I will delete it after.  Just so you can see the change.
There is now a secondary token.  It will not let you override them.  They must be deleted before you can make a new primary, secondary, or tertiary tokens.

Now for making the link
[https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=400x400&ecc=Q&margin=5&data=otpauth://totp/**(place**](https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=400x400&ecc=Q&margin=5&data=otpauth://totp/(place) **usernamehere)**%40openvista.net%3fsecret%3d**(placesecretcodehere)**%26algorithm%3dSHA1%26issuer%3dotp02e1-msc.openvista.net%26version%3d3%26digits%3d6%26period%3d30%26userid%3dSD677923%26domain%3dopenvista.net

for this example
Username: AT719871
Secret Code: lxfnlk74i7ror63wrrlic4xj3blm2ur4

Which makes the QR code link:

[https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=400x400&ecc=Q&margin=5&data=otpauth://totp/AT719871%40openvista.net%3fsecret%3dlxfnlk74i7ror63wrrlic4xj3blm2ur4%26algorithm%3dSHA1%26issuer%3dotp02e1-msc.openvista.net%26version%3d3%26digits%3d6%26period%3d30%26userid%3dSD677923%26domain%3dopenvista.net](https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=400x400&ecc=Q&margin=5&data=otpauth://totp/AT719871%40openvista.net%3fsecret%3dlxfnlk74i7ror63wrrlic4xj3blm2ur4%26algorithm%3dSHA1%26issuer%3dotp02e1-msc.openvista.net%26version%3d3%26digits%3d6%26period%3d30%26userid%3dSD677923%26domain%3dopenvista.net)
now copy it into a browser to get this
![==image_6==.png](/.attachments/==image_6==-aaeee382-d676-44a5-857f-419ceff5768a.png) 
I then scanned it into the app to make sure that it scanned.  I do not have a screenshot of this it is my standard practice.
